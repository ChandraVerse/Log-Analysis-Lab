SOC Analyst Log Analysis Documentation
1. Overview
This document summarizes the end-to-end analysis of a synthetic multi-source log file ingested into a log management platform to simulate real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows.
The dataset was intentionally crafted to represent multiple attack techniques across authentication, web application, endpoint, network, cloud, and database layers.

Primary goals:

* Practice structured log analysis and correlation across sources.
* Identify and understand common attacker behaviors as they appear in logs.
* Derive detection ideas and monitoring strategies suitable for a SOC environment.
* Capture findings and reasoning in a professional, reproducible format.

---

2. Log Sources and Structure
The log file is in JSON Lines (JSONL) format, with one JSON object per line. Each record contains normalized fields to simplify searching and correlation, including:

* ts – Event timestamp (UTC).
* env – Environment (e.g., lab).
* log_type – High-level source category:
  > auth, web, endpoint, network, identity, cloud, db.
* host – Hostname or system identifier.
* app – Application or subsystem (e.g., sshd, nginx, cloudtrail).
* severity – Event severity (info, warning, critical).
* event – Normalized event name (e.g., login_failed, waf_alert).
* Additional fields:
  > Auth: user, src_ip, command, method, reason.
  > Web: client_ip, path, status, ua, query.
  > Endpoint: process, cmdline, parent.
  > Network: dst_ip, dst_port, action, ja3.
  > Cloud: actor, action_name, policy, mfa_used.
  > DB: db_user, db_name, query_fingerprint, rows_returned, duration_ms.

This normalized schema enables field-based searches and correlations, mirroring how production SIEM/log platforms operate.

3. Analysis Methodology
The investigation followed a structured SOC-style workflow:

* Baseline understanding
  > Identify log types and typical benign events (e.g., normal web requests, successful logins, standard outbound HTTPS).

* Detection-focused searches
  > Use targeted queries for known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) such as:
    > Brute-force and password spray.
    > Web reconnaissance and SQL injection.
    > Malware execution and C2 traffic.
    > Cloud IAM privilege escalation.
    > Database exfiltration.
    > Log tampering and covering tracks.

* Event correlation
  > Pivot on shared fields (user, src_ip, src_host) to link activity across layers.

* Timeline reconstruction
  > Order key events chronologically to understand attacker progression.

* Findings, impact, and detection ideas
  > Summarize what happened, why it matters, and how to detect it systematically.

4. Detailed Findings
4.1 SSH Brute-Force Attacks
  * Observed behavior:
    > Multiple login_failed events on log_type: auth, targeting user: root on host: linux-web-01.
    > Repeated failures from a single external src_ip (geo-located to Russia in the synthetic data).
    > A subsequent event: bruteforce_suspected with fail_count_5m elevated and action: blocked, indicating automated blocking (e.g., Fail2Ban-like control).
* Interpretation:
  > This pattern matches a classic SSH brute-force attack: an attacker systematically guesses passwords for the root account from a single IP in a short time period.

* Detection ideas:
  > Threshold rule: N failed SSH logins from a single source IP within X minutes.
  > Additional condition: target is a highly privileged account (e.g., root, admin).
  > Look for follow-up successful login from the same IP for potential compromise.

---

4.2 Web Reconnaissance & SQL Injection
  * Observed behavior:
    > log_type: web events with paths such as:
                /.env, /wp-login.php, /phpinfo.php.
    > User-agent indicating an automated scanner (Nikto style).
    > A critical WAF event:
      # event: waf_alert, path: /search, with a query parameter resembling q=' OR 1=1--.
      # status: 403, rule_id indicating SQL injection prevention.

  * Interpretation:
    > The attacker performs reconnaissance by probing for common misconfigurations or sensitive files, then attempts a SQL injection that is blocked by the WAF.

  * Detection ideas:
    > Monitor for scanner-like user agents and frequent 404s on sensitive paths.
    > Raise alerts on WAF signatures for SQL injection, especially if they are not consistently blocked.
    > Correlate scanner IPs across web, WAF, and potentially firewall logs.

---

4.3 Password Spray
  * Observed behavior:
    > log_type: identity, app: sso, with event: password_spray_suspected.
    > Elevated users_attempted value (e.g., 18 users).
    > All attempts failing in a short time window (fail_count_10m > 0, success_count_10m = 0).
    > Single source IP associated with all attempts.

  * Interpretation:
    > Unlike brute-force against a single user, password spraying spreads attempts across many users to evade lockouts and simple thresholds. The logs explicitly flag this behavior.

  * Detection ideas:
    > Count distinct user values per src_ip over a given time window.
    > Flag when a single IP attempts logins for many accounts with consistent failures.
    > Combine with impossible travel or unusual geo indicators for higher confidence.

---

4.4 Impossible Travel
  * Observed behavior:
    > event: mfa_success for user finance1 from geo_country: IN.
    > Within one minute, event: impossible_travel for the same user from geo_country: US.
    > Fields such as prev_ip, prev_geo_country, and time_since_prev_minutes highlight the anomaly.

  * Interpretation:
    > This is a strong signal of potential account or session compromise; the same account is apparently active from geographically distant locations in an impossible time frame.

  * Detection ideas:
    > Compare geographic locations of consecutive logins for a user.
    > Flag if the required travel speed exceeds realistic thresholds.
    > Prioritize when combined with high-privilege users or sensitive applications (e.g., finance, admin).

---

4.5 Malware Indicators (Endpoint + Network)
  * Observed behavior:

    > Endpoint logs:
      # log_type: endpoint, event: process_start.
      # process: powershell.exe with cmdline including -enc and a long Base64 string (encoded PowerShell).

    > DNS logs:
      # event: dns_query for a domain resembling a legitimate vendor (update-microsoft-security[...]), but with subtle differences suggesting typosquatting.

    > Firewall logs:
      # event: outbound_connection from the same host to an external IP and non-standard port (e.g., 8080).
      # Message indicating “Possible C2 beacon” based on behavior.

  * Interpretation:
    > This chain suggests malicious script execution on the endpoint followed by DNS resolution to a suspicious domain and C2 communication to an external IP. It models post-exploitation behavior.

  * Detection ideas:
    > Flag PowerShell commands with -enc, especially those launched by user-facing processes.
    > Monitor DNS queries to lookalike or low-reputation domains.
    > Detect periodic short outbound connections to a small set of external IPs (beaconing patterns).
    > Correlate endpoint and network logs via src_host / src_ip.

---

4.6 Cloud Privilege Escalation (IAM)
  * Observed behavior:
    > log_type: cloud, app: cloudtrail style logs.
    > event: iam_policy_change where a non-admin or temporary user attaches AdministratorAccess to another user.
    > mfa_used: false for the action, indicating no MFA protection for a highly sensitive change.

  * Interpretation:
    > This is a high-risk IAM privilege escalation: a user account with limited intended privileges effectively grants admin rights, without MFA. In a real environment, this could enable full compromise of cloud resources.

  * Detection ideas:
    > Monitor for AttachUserPolicy / AttachRolePolicy actions involving AdministratorAccess or similar high-privilege policies.
    > Require and validate mfa_used = true for sensitive IAM changes.
    > Correlate with login events from unusual IPs or locations.

---

4.7 Database Exfiltration
  * Observed behavior:
    > log_type: db, event: suspicious_query.
    > query_fingerprint: UNION_SELECT.
    > High rows_returned (e.g., 5000) and non-trivial duration_ms.
    > Access via db_user: appuser from an internal application host.

  * Interpretation:
    > The combination of UNION SELECT patterns, large result sets, and atypical query fingerprints for an application account suggests potential SQL injection and data exfiltration.

  * Detection ideas:
    > Flag queries with known exfiltration patterns (UNION SELECT, INFORMATION_SCHEMA, etc.).
    > Monitor for unusually high rows_returned per query for application users.
    > Correlate with web/WAF logs showing injection attempts.

---

4.8 Log Tampering and Covering Tracks
  * Observed behavior:
    > event: privilege_escalation via sudo (e.g., sudo useradd backup_admin).
    > Subsequent event: audit_log_cleared on the same host.
    > Command field showing truncate -s 0 /var/log/auth.log.

  * Interpretation:
    > This sequence indicates successful privilege escalation followed by deliberate log wiping to erase evidence. This is a strong indicator of a serious compromise and an attempt to evade detection.

  * Detection ideas:
    > Alert on log-clearing commands targeting key log files (auth.log, syslog, Windows event logs).
    > Pay particular attention when such commands follow privilege escalation, suspicious logins, or other critical events.
    > Implement additional immutable or remote logging to prevent total loss of evidence.

---

5. Monitoring Strategy and Next Steps
  * From this lab, the following monitoring strategy emerges:

    > Baseline + anomalies: Understand what normal login, web, DB, and cloud activity looks like, then detect deviations.
    > Multi-layer correlation: Build workflows that pivot across authentication, endpoint, network, cloud, and DB logs using shared entities (user, host, IP).
    > Detection content: Translate patterns into:
      # Search queries for manual threat hunting.
      # Candidate detection rules for SIEM/SOAR tools.

    > Incident documentation: For each scenario, maintain short incident-style summaries with:
      # Timeline of events.
      # Affected assets and identities.
      # Impact and risk assessment.
      # Recommended remediation and hardening actions.
